Hey!

Here I build some LLMs.
They are decoder only ChatGPT style

One of them is trained locally
One of them uses the ChatGPT 2 open weights.

Thanks to Sebastian Raschka for letting me use his book + code to get me started. (Check out his copyright + I may have edited the code so might not be the same!)
Enjoy.
